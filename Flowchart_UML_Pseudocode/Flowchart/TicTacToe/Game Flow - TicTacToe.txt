 Game Flow:

3.	The game prompts the current player to make a move by clicking on a cell in the game board.
4.	The player clicks on a cell.
5.	The game checks if the move is valid (i.e., the selected cell is empty).
6.	If the move is valid, the game updates the board and GUI with the player's symbol.
7.	If the move is invalid, the game displays an "Invalid Move" message.
8.	The game determines the current game state based on the updated board.
9.	If the game is not over, the game updates the turn and prompts the next player to make a move (go back to step 3).
10.	If the game is over (i.e., a player has won, or the board is full), the game proceeds to the next step.
11.	The game displays the result in a dialog box (e.g., "Player X wins!" or "It's a draw!").
12.	The game resets the board and the game state and prompts the players to start a new game (go back to step 3).
