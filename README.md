How to play!
------------------------------
Maze Solver - State Design
---------------------
This is a 1 player game, the player must go through the maze and find a path to reach the destination.
To do this use your arrow keys on your computer/ laptop to direct your character to the destination.
When successful, a message will pop up to congratulate you.
Then either your path or an alternative path will appear to display to you a the quickest path.
